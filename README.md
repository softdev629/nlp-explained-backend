# NLP Posts Backend

A Flask-based backend service that provides an API to serve Natural Language Processing (NLP) posts. The API delivers paginated data without reliance on a database, ensuring simplicity, performance, and ease of deployment.

---

## Features

- **RESTful API**: A straightforward API for accessing NLP-related posts.
- **Pagination Support**: Handles large data effectively by providing paginated responses.
- **JSON Responses**: Returns clean, consumable JSON data for integration with frontend applications.
- **Stateless and Lightweight**: No database - posts are fetched from an in-memory structure or static file.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: A pure Flask project to ensure easy setup and maintenance.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language for the backend development.
- **Flask**: A minimal and lightweight Python web framework.
- **Flask-RESTful**: For building clean RESTful APIs.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for dynamic updates to the static dataset (e.g., file-based modifications).
- Implement advanced filtering and searching for NLP posts.
- Add authentication and rate limiting for secured access.
- Extend to a microservice architecture if required for scaling.
